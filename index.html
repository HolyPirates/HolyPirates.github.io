										<p>Born and raised in Australia, Jordan can’t remember a time when I wasn’t interested in IT. This has mainly come from computer gaming, but as he grew older, his interest broadened to other areas of the industry. Driven by his curious nature, he is enthralled with the world of technology and its rapid advancements. Jordan followed this interest into a career in the industry and has worked for almost 2 years now in quality assurance for an Australian IT consultancy. He looks forward to being a part of the Holy Pirates!

										<p>I have lived in Ballarat my whole life except for 6 months where I lived in Lake Louise, Canada to be a ski instructor on my gap year. My hobbies include, aviation, gaming, and music. I have always been interested in IT and have been a natural tinker my whole life. I used to build drones and electric skateboards for fun and have moved more into youtube and content creation in my later years. I’m excited to be part of the Holy Pirates and hope we can produce some awesome materials.</p>

He completed a Tafe diploma in Networking as his first step into the IT world. With that degree he now works as a Support Technician for a Point of Sale company based in Chatswood. He has been working in that job for the past 3 years and now hopes to improve his qualifications to move onto bigger and better things. He is looking forward to getting along with the other members of the Holy Pirates this semester.

										John has been on the periphery of information technology for most of his life. From personal interaction in digital technology, gaming and the physical technology itself, to seeing both his previous academic and professional fields move towards and embrace digital platforms, his fascination with information technology has grown steadily over time. And as the exponential growth of technology gets further entwined with society as a whole, he can only see this fascination grow to ever larger. He is the latest member of the Holy Pirates.

								Based on the results above, it seems that members of the Holy Pirates have quite a diversity when it comes to personality traits. The is seen in the results of the Meyers-Briggs test which shows that almost each member has their own unique classification within the scope of the group. This is a great outcome as it will hopefully result in less conflicts in areas such as leadership. It will also hopefully mean that each member will be able to provide a unique perspective on aspects of the assignment, resulting in a broader pool of ideas and strategies.  
<br><br>Diversity can also be seen (Although to a lesser extent), in the learning styles of each of the members. With this being an introduction course, it is important to be able to pick things up quickly. A more diverse grouping of learning styles will mean that where one person might fail to grasp a concept, a different member of the group could excel, and vice versa. If these members were to share bits of what they each individually have learnt, each would walk away with a much clearer picture of the concept as a whole. 
<br><br>In saying this however, it must be noted that all group members were rated as a ‘Visual’ learner as one of their learning style aspects. This will be good to keep in mind going forward in the case that learning material needs to be shared between the group. In light of the results above, this material would be best suited in a visual format if possible. 
<br><br>A final note is that both Ervine and Aidan both scored very highly on their ‘Agreeableness’ traits from the Big 5 Personalities test. A trait such as this is perfect for group work to reduce the risk of conflicts.

										<h2 class="major">Ideal Jobs</h2>
										<h3>These are the Ideal jobs we have chosen:</h3>
										<h4>Aidan: IT Support Officer</h4>
										<h4>Ervine:  Backend Developer</h4>
										<h4>John: Front-End Developer</h4>
										<h4>Jordan: Senior Gameplay Programmer</h4>
										<h4>Ned: Data Scientist</h4>
										<p>From the Job Titles above you can see that 3 of us want to be developers/programmers while Aidan would like to be involved in IT Support and Ned would like to be a data scientist.  </p>
										<p>Ervine, John and Jordan’s Roles are very similar in that they will all be programming roles related to the development of said programs. They are slightly different though as John will work on the front-end which is the graphical user interface that the user uses to interact with the program. This sits in contrast to Ervine’s role as a back-end developer which is about how the program runs on the hardware and executes the user’s commands. Jordan’s role sits in the middle as he will be charged with coming up with innovative gameplay mechanics and systems and programming them to satisfy users.</p>
										<p>Ned’s Data scientist role is different from the above in that he will be using programming to design and implement predictive models to analyse large amounts of data. This data will then be used by his company to make business decisions.</p>
										<p>Aidan’s IT Support Role is different from these as he will not be developing a program or analysing data but helping the end user. He will troubleshoot any issues they may encounter both hardware and software. So, he will have to be knowledgeable in both to be able to provide the proper support to his clients.</p>
